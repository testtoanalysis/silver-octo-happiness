> Core is a platform, a collection of components for rapid application development. It doesn't make decisions for you; it gives you tools to build your own solutions.


## Installation

Install via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/):

```bash
$ composer require caffeina-core/core
```

## Documentation

See the [wiki](https://github.com/caffeina-core/core/wiki).


## Contributing

How to get involved:

1. [Star](https://github.com/caffeina-core/core/stargazers) the project!
2. Answer questions that come through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/caffeina-core/core/issues?state=open)
3. [Report a bug](https://github.com/caffeina-core/core/issues/new) that you find

Core follows the [GitFlow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model). The ```master``` branch always reflects a production-ready state while the latest development is taking place in the ```develop``` branch.

Each time you want to work on a fix or a new feature, create a new branch based on the ```develop``` branch: ```git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME develop```. Only pull requests to the ```develop``` branch will be merged.

Pull requests are **highly appreciated**.

Solve a problem. Features are great, but even better is cleaning-up and fixing issues in the code that you discover.

## Versioning
